# Guidelines

## Assignments and projects

Each assignment or project you work on can have its own group with pages and subpages for each part of the project. The _Network Exploration_ group is provided as an example page structure for the first project. Feel free to rearrange how you see fit. Guidelines for pages and subpages:

* Be organized into different parts of the project, e.g., the map and packet analysis for the network exploration project
* Include a description of your process: What did you do and learn? Where did you get stuck? Who or where did you find help? If you worked in a group, how did you manage division of labor and what were your specific contributions? What did you learn from your collaborators?
* Include a link to the GitHub repo for code and documentation. When you go to _Insert Subpage_ you have options to insert a new document page or a new link.&#x20;

It would be expected for anyone who regularly works in groups to include evidence of further exploration or engagement with the topics, proportional to how much work is perceived to be mitigated by collaborating. This could look like additional or extended features on some assignments, above average participation in the "Good Questions" discussion board and corresponding reflections (see next section), or more elaborate final projects.

Similarly, it would be reasonable to make less progress towards the completion of one assignment in order to further explore and engage with another topic. Just make sure you try everything and documentyour progress.&#x20;

Keep in mind our intended **learning outcomes** so you can be intentional about how you spend your time based on what you want to learn most. It is important to spend some time on each, but there is no expectation of equal mastery of all of them.

* Describe the network layers and explain why abstraction is important
* Write programs that communicate with programs on another computer at the socket and application levels
* Examine network traffic using packet analysis
* Compare protocols and other networking considerations for a variety of contexts and applications
* Perform assorted monitoring, administration, security, and communication tasks using various network utilities
* Describe the current state and history of LMU’s network

## Participation & engagement

Keep a log of your participation in class community spaces. This doesn't have to be a perfect record, it just gives us some data to review together at check-ins. For example, _what keeps you from participating in class discussions?_ Maybe it's intimidating or uncomfortable–we can brainstorm what might make it less so. Maybe you have trouble following along or staying focused–we can brainstorm what I might be able to do to make discussions, lectures, code alongs, etc. easier to follow such as more visual aids, metaphors, or breaks. Maybe you are enjoying following along and are getting as much out of class time as you would like to–cool. Keep on keeping on. :relaxed:

Not everyone needs to have a ton of participation of all types, but ideally there will be some amount of each and maybe some more than others. You can decide what works for you.

## Reflections

Every 3 weeks, write a few paragraphs about what you've been working on and learning.
