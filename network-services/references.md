  How was the code you ended up with similar to or different from the examples
  in the resources linked above? Do you understand how your programs work?

The code was somewhat similar following the steps correctly.&#x20;

I do understand the programs and how to run them but could not figure out why it would not work the same as samples even though the code is similar&#x20;



I spent time debugging but still could not figure it out.. even when I ChatGPT or stack overflowed it.&#x20;

however, even though it did not work I found that I still know how to duplicate the other codes and fully understand how they work and how to run each.&#x20;
