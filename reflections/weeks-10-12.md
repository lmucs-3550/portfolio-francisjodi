# Weeks 10-12

Caught the tail end of the mozfest and they talked a bit about how back in the days amazon was not a thing it is nice to see how technology has helped us evolve and the way the internet helps us in life. PS the French toasts were sooo good!&#x20;



* Project 3

Did more work on project 3, especially after finalizing the idea with Professor. which we decided on analyzing transportation networks. This was a very cool topic to find out about, especially since i was just about to hop on plane to attend a family funeral.&#x20;

presented on this topic and found some fascinating this that I also taught my family on the plane, especially being so upset about the wifi not working on my 9+ hour flight. :( &#x20;



security:

password manager threats&#x20;

threat model for a password manager?&#x20;

* someone could have your password and it can be compromised&#x20;

what could go wrong?&#x20;

* someone can be malicious with your passwords&#x20;

are all password managers' threat models different?

* could be based on life and what you are using it for or even using it on(browser vs physical)
