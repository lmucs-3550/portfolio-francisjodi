Caught the tail end of the mozfest and they talked a bit about how back in the days amazon was not a thing it is nice to see how technology has helped us evolve and the way the internet helps us in life.



security:

password manager threats&#x20;

threat model for a password manager?&#x20;

* someone could have your password and it can be compromised&#x20;

what could go wrong?&#x20;

* someone can be malicious with your passwords&#x20;

are all password managers' threat models different?

* could be based on life and what you are using it for or even using it on(browser vs physical)
