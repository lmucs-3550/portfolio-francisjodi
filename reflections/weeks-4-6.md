# Weeks 4-6

I was focusing my time majority learning content that has to do with layers (Applicationm transportm data link and physical) for each layers, i learnt that:&#x20;

* In the network, it does not need-> application
* Data link is local delivery of packets --> needed on network
* Network switches and routers have the layers -> network, data link, physical

#### E2e principle&#x20;

Why is this assignment of tasks good?

If one goes down it does not interrupt others

You get feedback on whether or not messages is arriving in order

\*\*\*\* Reliability in e2e Is more efficient because you do not have to implement in the beginning so you do not have to send to the whole path



#### Routers and switches&#x20;

A router will implement IP at the network layer, Eth @ Data link layer

Note(ip worried about different networks)

&#x20;HTTP messages-> At each ip hop u exchange ip packets '

#### Ethernets&#x20;

Local area network is fast by mile

Direct link issues

* Encoding
* Framing
* Error detecting
* Perceived reliability
* Access mediation

Errors:&#x20;

* Encoding, framing
* No error detecting
* No perceived reliability





8 bit = 10011010

| Types of errors | A--> sum =4           | B --> even = True(1) |
| --------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| Single bit      | Always - sum off by 1 | Always               |
| Double bit      | Depends               |                      |
| Odd #           | Always -be off by 1   |                      |
| Burst           | Depends               |                      |



Detection

Require few redundant bit all of the time

Require retransmission some of the time

Medium is generally reliable or retransmission fast



Correction

An additional bit of time
