march 14: linking networks, paths networks take

march 16:&#x20;

review from last class: congestion control

* reservations&#x20;
* pricing&#x20;
* &#x20;dynamic adjustment&#x20;
  * host-based&#x20;
  * routers

if not congested then host-based is either lost, delayed, or both. a loss is already really bad and the rate we send at us is already a problem as the TCP timeouts.  a delay when duplicating ACKs.&#x20;

leads of alternatives&#x20;

adaptive increase, decrease&#x20;

effiency lines tell you increase or decrease&#x20;

TCP: pick intial rate r&#x20;

congstion= increase&#x20;

no congestion= decrease&#x20;

we land on equilibrium
