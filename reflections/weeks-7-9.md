# Weeks 7-9

for these couple of weeks I have been working on the follwing&#x20;



* project 2&#x20;

I worked on the tutorials of sequential serve and tic tac toe using servers. I found this extremely cool and loved that I could have capitalized each word. The tic tac toe was probably my favorite, bringing back my childhood to something I could have built.&#x20;

I decided to create a conversational bot by a server. I think I got the gist of what is supposed to be done but the server part was the hardest. I plan on working on this a bit more.&#x20;

* network exploration&#x20;

I needed to finish this so I reviewed my code and work but was still unable to figure it out. I also tried to go to a coffee shop in my free time but it became quickly filled with other things i needed to attend or do.&#x20;

* project 3&#x20;

I started ideating about what this project would be about

* midterm activity&#x20;

Erika and I did the commercial passenger flight - finding lost devices or items. i thought this project was super cute and fun I could have brought out the creative side as well as a nice way to learn the layers and relate it to something we came up with. Our drawing can be found below&#x20;

* final project ideation

started ideating about this and would bring up some points to professor in mid sem check ins. &#x20;





march 14: linking networks, paths networks take

march 16:&#x20;

review from last class: congestion control

* reservations&#x20;
* pricing&#x20;
* &#x20;dynamic adjustment&#x20;
  * host-based&#x20;
  * routers

if not congested then host-based is either lost, delayed, or both. a loss is already really bad and the rate we send at us is already a problem as the TCP timeouts.  a delay when duplicating ACKs.&#x20;



New Content&#x20;

leads of alternatives&#x20;

adaptive increase, decrease&#x20;

effiency lines tell you increase or decrease&#x20;



how alternatives are implemented&#x20;

TCP: pick intial rate r&#x20;

congstion= increase&#x20;

no congestion= decrease&#x20;

we land on equilibrium

&#x20;
